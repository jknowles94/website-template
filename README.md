# Website template
Website template with Bootstrap 3 and basic sass styling and mixins

Includes jquery plugins that I use the most

Mixins come mainly from Bootstrap with a couple I've added myself - mainly the REM and center align

When using the updated slidebars plugin - use on('touchend click') event for the close functionallity to work on mobile devices

For modernizer follow these instructions - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27302498/bower-install-modernizr-where-is-modernizr-js
